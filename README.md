#Tamagotchi Front End

This tamagotchi app allows users to maintain a database of pets and feed, scold, and play with them. Users are also able to create new pets to interact with and delete pets.

Deploy your API.
Create a front-end that implements CRUD features against your existing API.
Practice React: useState, useEffect, maybe 'React Query', and React Router
